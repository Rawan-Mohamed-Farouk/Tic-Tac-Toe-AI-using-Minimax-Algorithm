# Project Title: Tic-Tac-Toe AI using Minimax Algorithm

## Description
The Tic-Tac-Toe AI using Minimax Algorithm is a Python program where players compete against an AI opponent. The AI uses the minimax algorithm to make optimal moves in a standard Tic-Tac-Toe game on a 3x3 grid. It evaluates possible future moves to ensure it chooses the best move based on the current game state.
